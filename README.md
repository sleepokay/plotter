# Plotter Sketches

These are lightweight experiments with the HP7440A plotter sitting in the art room at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com).

Currently, there are two example scripts I've copied from [DJ Balan](https://github.com/dbalan/plotter-scripts) as well as a visualization of the Collatz sequences based on Edmund Harriss' work.
