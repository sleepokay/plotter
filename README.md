# Plotter Sketches

These are lightweight experiments with [the plotter](https://github.com/recursecenter/wiki/wiki/Plotter-(HP7440A)) at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com).

Currently, there are two examples I've copied from [DJ Balan](https://github.com/dbalan/plotter-scripts) as well as a visualization of the Collatz sequences based on Edmund Harriss' work.
